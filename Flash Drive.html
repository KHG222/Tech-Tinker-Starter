2. **Bootable Installers**
   Standard solution for deploying operating systems (Windows, Linux distros, ChromeOS Flex). Also used for BIOS/UEFI updates in controlled maintenance cycles.

3. **On-Device Backups**
   Localized backup strategy for documents, configurations, or small datasets. Offers an air-gapped safeguard against ransomware and system corruption.

4. **Secure Data Vaulting**
   With encryption, flash drives become low-cost secure containers for credential vaults, client deliverables, or confidential business documentation.

5. **Portable Applications**
   Executing apps directly from the drive (portable builds of IDEs, browsers, utilities). Supports clean, non-install workflows—critical for shared or restricted machines.

6. **Media Deployment**
   Used to preload marketing assets, presentations, product catalogs, or demo software for field teams and events.


8. **Firmware Flashing & Embedded Workflows**
   Common in IT repair, microcontroller development, and hardware provisioning. Drives serve as update media for routers, servers, thin clients, TVs, and IoT devices.

9. **System Recovery & Diagnostics**
   Hosted recovery environments (WinRE, Linux live environments, OEM tools) for incident response, crash analysis, and system rebuilds.

10. **Long-Term Archival (Short to Mid-Term)**
    While not ideal for deep archival, flash drives can hold legal documents, contracts, and project snapshots for multi-year retention if stored properly.
