<h1 class="sectionheader">Laptops</h1>
<p>Laptops deliver computing capability on the go. They are portable systems that typically offer lower performance per dollar compared to desktops, yet carry a higher price tag due to their compact design. They excel in business, professional, and personal use cases where mobility is a priority. However, most laptops provide limited upgrade options and minimal repairability.</p>

<h1>Upgradable Laptop Parts</h1>
<p>While not as modular as desktops, certain components remain upgradable on many models: RAM, NVMe storage, Wi-Fi modules, and batteries. Business-class devices typically offer the highest serviceability, while ultra-thin consumer models skew toward soldered components. But even if the parts arent soldered, it might be hard to find replacement parts. Companys would rather you buy a whole new device as they make more money than have you repair your device.</p>
<hr class="mini">
<h1>Desktops VS Laptops</h1>
<p>A lot of people debate wether or not to get a laptop or desktop. Desktops are powerful but are stationary, while laptops let you work from the bus, your friends house, class or even while we don't really like to admit it your bed or couch.</p>
